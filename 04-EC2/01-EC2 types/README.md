# EC2 types

* Ec2 has CPU, memory, local storege capacity & type

* everything in EC2 is ratios like (1 CPU - 1GB memory)

* Storage and data network bandwidth

* EC2 has additional features and capabilities

## EC2 Categories

* `General purpose` - default and it is used for diverse workloads and equal resource ration - A1, M6g, T3, T3a, M5, M5a, M5n

* `Compute optimized` - media processing, HPC, scientific modelling, gaming, machine learning - C5, C5n 

* `Memory Optimized` - processing large in-memory datasets, some database workloads - R5, R5a, X1, X1e, high memory (u-Xtb1), zld

* `Accelerated Computing` - hardware GPU, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) - p3, G4, F1, Inf1

* `Storage Optimized` - sequential and Random IO - scale-out transactional databases, data warehousing, elasticsearch, analytics workloads - I3/I3en, D2, H1

## Decoding EC2 type

instance generation - `5` additional capabilities - `dn`

             `R5dn.8xlarge`

Instance family- `R`  instance size - `8xlarge`

        `instance type`
