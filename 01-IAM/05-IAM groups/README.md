* IAM Group is a collection of users.

* Group specifies the permission for a collection of users, and it also makes it possible to manage the permissions easily for those users.

* You created a group known as Admin and assigned the permissions to the group that administrators need.

* Any user joins the admin group;

* then the user will have all the permissions that are assigned to the group.

* If a new user joins the organization, then he should have administrator privileges, and you can assign the appropriate permissions by adding him to the group.
  
* If a person changes his job profile, instead of editing his permissions, you can remove him from a group and add him to the group.

* 5000 IAM users per one account IAM is a Global Service.

* 1 User can add upto 10 IAM Groups
