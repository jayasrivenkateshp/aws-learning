## AWS Organization

* AWS Organizations is an AWS account management service that lets users centrally manage and control groups of AWS accounts, and the workflows and policies that apply to them.

* The management process can be done manually or programmatically at the API level. Users can:

* Integrate multiple AWS services with multiple unique AWS accounts.

* Manage the user environments based on organizational, legal, or project-based policies.

* The accounts can also share resources, security mechanisms, audit requirements, configurations, and policies  between multiple AWS organizations.

## User accounts in AWS Organizations

* Originally, Amazon Web Services began with a single user account that enrolled multiple AWS services. Each person used a single AWS account and subscribed to multiple AWS services as necessary.

* However, using a single account per user limits how organizations can manage the services, security permissions, audits, policies, and billings across multiple business divisions and projects assigned to the same user account.

*The concept of AWS account has evolved significantly since the inception of the AWS cloud service, which continues to grow, particularly in the areas of:

   - Solutions
   - Resource options
   - Billing
   - Configuration features

* Now, we can consider AWS accounts as containers that consist of such capabilities, all governed and managed across multiple AWS accounts but within the same centralized environment.

## Benefits of AWS Organizations

* Here’s why it makes sense to use multiple AWS accounts for the same categories of AWS resources contained in multiple unique and manageable account environments:

**Easily categorize and discover services**. Find and assign AWS applications programmatically using APIs, command line interface (CLI), and GUIs.

**Apply logical boundaries to all aspects of policies**. Different projects within the organization may be exposed to different security and compliance requirements. For example, by segregating AWS resources within multiple AWS accounts across all of those different projects, you can easily enforce unique identity policies in compliance to the applicable regulatory frameworks.

**Contain damage within logically isolated user accounts**. If a specific user account is compromised, only the resources assigned to that AWS Organizations user account will be exposed to the higher risk.

**Easily manage billing and resources on a project or task basis**. Employees can switch between their AWS Organizations accounts assigned to them and utilize resources optimally as required.
