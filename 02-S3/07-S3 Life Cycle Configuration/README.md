## S3 Life Cycle Configuration

* if you are going to upload anything (files,data,movies)but you need the data for sometime only(week,month)

* if they are used in for some time and after that i am going to put in archival data

* we are uploading some files for archival data 
   EX: office files,health care files

* with these life configuration rules it will delete automatically 

* S3 life cycle configuration has a file and it has some rules that are predifined to perform on objects during lifetime

* so it can delete specified objects based on life cycle configuration
