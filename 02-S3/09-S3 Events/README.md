# S3 Events

* You can use the Amazon S3 Event Notifications feature to receive notifications when certain events happen in your S3 bucket. 

* To enable notifications, you must first add a notification configuration that identifies the events you want Amazon S3 to publish and the destinations where you want Amazon S3 to send the notifications.

* You store this configuration in the notification subresource that is associated with a bucket.
