# S3 Replication

* Data replication in S3 refers to the process of copying data from an S3 bucket of your choice to another bucket in an automatic manner, without affecting any other operation.

*  With S3 replication in place, you can replicate data across buckets, either in the same or in a different region, known as Cross Region Replication. 
 
* Amazon S3 further maintains metadata and allows users to store information such as origin, modifications, etc. of the data source and monitor any changes.
