# S3 Security 

> At creation by default, all S3 resources are private and can only be accessed by the resource owner or account administrator. 

> you need to disable it manually 

> You can use S3 Block Public Access to restrict all access requests to your data.

>  A form of resource policy

> Like , Identity policies attached to a bucket

   - Identity policies - identity can access
   - Resource policy - who can access to that resource

> in S3 bucket you can access 2 types policies

## ACLs - Access Control lists

> inflexible & simple permissions

> read and write

> read-acp, write-acp

> full controll

## block public Access

> this is a default (block public Access)

> if we want to disable this we need to manually disable it 

> so that objects can be public by our choice
