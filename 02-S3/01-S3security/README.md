# S3 Security 

> At creation and by default, all S3 resources are private and can only be accessed by the resource owner or account administrator. 

> This security design lets you configure finely-tuned access policies that align to organizational, governance, security, and compliance requirements. 

> You can use S3 Block Public Access to restrict all access requests to your data. S3 also lets you chose among different encryption options

>  A form of resource policy

> Like , Identity policies attached to a bucket

   - Identity policies - identity can access
   - Resource policy - who can access to that resource

> in S3 bucket you can access 2 types policies

## ACLs - Access Control lists

> inflexible & simple permissions

> read and write

> read-acp, write-acp

> full controll

## block public Access

> this is a default (block public Access)

> if we want to disable this we need to manually disable it 

> so that objects can be public  of our choice
